## Transaction in postgresql
- Uses `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` to prevent concurrency + deadlock issues:
    - `FOR UPDATE` will create a lock in `SELECT` until and `UPDATE` occurs in the transacion
    - Deadlock (`NO KEY` prevents a deadlock between an `INSERT` and the concurrent `SELECT FOR UPDATE`)
    - Order is important: if the two same accounts are updated concurrently, make sure they are updated in the same order (to prevent a situation where `processA` locks `account1`, `processB` locks `account2`, and then `processA` cannot access `account2` and viceversa)
- In order to debug concurrent DB transactions, some useful queries ((postgres wiki)[https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Lock_Monitoring]):
```

Deadlock may come from an INSERT query with a foreign key constraint, concurrent with a SELECT query with a FOR UPDATE constraint


## Read phenomena -> Transaction isolation level

- Dirty read -> read-uncommitted
- Phanton read -> read-committed
- Non-repeatable read -> repeatable-read
- Serialization anomaly -> serializable

## Postgres vs MySQL
- Each DB uses different isolation levels by default
- Postgres uses a depedency mechanism, while MySQL uses a lock
